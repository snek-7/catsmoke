# catsmokebot
An open-source Discord bot built with [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/).

## Contributing
Each plugin has a specified scope, eg. the "paint.py" plugin handles assigning colored user roles.

If the functionality you want to add should be included in the scope of an existing plugin, make a pull request for the relevant plugin.

If your functionality is out of scope of any existing plugins, create a new plugin file for it in the form of a Python file, hosting a [Discord.py Cog](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ext/commands/cogs.html).
